Description: In a digital ecosystem saturated with advertisements, accurately predicting success is pivotal for businesses. Adbot aims to empower its small business clients with actionable insights to refine their ad campaigns and bolster customer engagement.

The objective of this challenge is to accurately predict the number of clicks a client’s ad receives, one and two weeks into the future (in digital marketing, clicks refer to when someone views the advert and follows one of the hyperlinks in that advert). Winning solutions will further be required to submit a description of the variables that had the most significant impact on engagement (number of clicks). It is therefore important that the models you build are not only accurate, but also interpretable.

Solving this problem holds immense potential for the small African businesses leveraging the Adbot platform. Accurate ad impression and click-through-rate forecasting can revolutionise marketing strategies, enabling businesses to allocate resources effectively and maximise ad campaign ROI. By providing actionable insights, Adbot empowers clients to optimise their advertising efforts, improving customer engagement and driving business growth.
